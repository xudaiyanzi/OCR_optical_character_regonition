# OCR_optical_character_recognition

This project teaches the beginner to detect the text from the image. It starts from the basic easy library implementation to advanced model utilization. It gives step by step guidance in each script to help the users to understand each process.

- Step1: introduce the easyOCR - a free API to help you read the letters from the image. It can give you bounding box coordinates around the letter, the letter text, and the confidence score / probability on its prediction
- Step2: introduce the YOLO - a free real-time object detection and image segmentation model. The detail history of YOLO is [here ](https://docs.ultralytics.com/). In this step, we use the early version v3 for simiplity, in the other tutorial projects, we will introduce more updated  version.
- Step3: introduce the OCR combined with YOLO and easyOCR. Make sure you finish step 1 and 2 before process to step 3.
